# HL7V2 Parser and Viewer
 HL7 v2 message parser and viewer

Installation: Download and serve.

Open http://<install_directory>/index.htm

Note that the app uses ajax requests to load resource files. Most web browsers won't run these requests on a local file, so you need to serve index.htm from a local file server.

Paste your HL7 v2 message and view message.
